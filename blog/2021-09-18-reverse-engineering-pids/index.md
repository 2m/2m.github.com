Car telemetry is a bit of a black magic. New cars are full of sensors that report readings on internal CAN buses. This data is accessible via a basic OBD adapter. However one needs to know the exact sensor PID value to query the sensor. The received data is usually in a raw form and needs to be converted to something usable by applying a specific formula. PID values and formulas are not shared by car manufacturers. Here is my attempt to make some sence of the GR Yaris OBD data.

Thanks to [this thread] we now know that selecting Toyota Camry 2020 in [OBDLink] Android app gives access to GR Yaris additional sensors.

It is relatively easy to snoop Bluetooth traffic on Android devices from [bugreports] or [even live]. So I selected a couple of sensors in OBDLink on continuous monitoring and looked into the BT traffic using [Wireshark]. Here is a little snippet from the quite verbose conversation:

  Capture of Bluetooth traffic between OBDLink and the car

These are ELM327 microcontroler, that runs inside OBDLink, [AT protocol commands]. Interesting ones here are:
* `ATSH 0007D0` - sets OBD header for all subsequent OBD commands
* `2162` - queries OBD Mode 21 PID 62 and gets `7D8 05 61 62 03 00 00 0` as a response

[AT protocol commands]: https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Widgets/ELM327_AT_Commands.pdf

First three hex digits in the response `7D8` is the [ID of the ECU] that has sent the response. Next three bytes `05 61 62` I am not sure what they are. And next three bytes `03 00 00` is the actual data that could be interesting.

Here is the short list of OBD Headers, Modes and PIDs that I was able to figure out from the first initial look and from subsequent help of other gr-yaris.co.uk forum members below:

[^1]: formulas are the tricky part

This is not much yet, but at least I hope this is enough information for anyone to join into this reverse engineering party.

CSV file that can be imported into Torque app for the custom PIDs can be found [here].
