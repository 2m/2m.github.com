Hello world!

Well so happens that I have been selected to participate in the Google Summer of Code 2010 under the "Charts in phpMyAdmin" project. This is actually the main reason to start this blog, although I wanted one for a long time now.

<!--truncate-->

I am really excited about GSOC. Yesterday around 19 o'clock UTC it was really fun to watch and to participate in a #gsoc IRC channel at freenode. All these students talking nonsense and really getting exciting no less then I was. And then after results came in jumping and shouting in my room for about five minutes (wonder what my neighbors
thought...).

Anyway it was great to be selected, I believe it will be even better experience to participate. Now it is the community bonding period. So I better go and bond a little bit. By the way, yesterday one student after being selected asked if drinking beer together with mentors counts as community bonding activity. Nice thought to leave you with.

Take care.
